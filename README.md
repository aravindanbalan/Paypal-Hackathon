Paypal-Hackathon
================

The idea of this application is to make the entire ecommerce experience image centric. Take a photo of a product you want to buy or sell and let SnapShot do the rest of the work. SnapShot identifies the image and extracts the relevant keywords (Through the Camfind API) and then redirects the user to the ebay buy and sell page. In the buy page, the buyer sees relevant items on ebay similar to the product whose photo he took and in the sell page, the page is autopopulated with details relevant to the product. So with this, the entire selling process becomes as easy as taking a picture! 

This is an android application and works best in Android 4.4.4. 

How to Use?

Just install the app on your phone through eclipse and take an image (or import from gallery). Then clicking SnapSearch redirects you to the results page with 2 tabs for buying and selling the product.
